# Stock Price Predictor

A machine learning pipeline that predicts stock prices using historical data, interest rates, and news sentiment (done in a separate project).

## 🔧 Features
- **Regression modeling** using Python and SQL to forecast stock prices  
- **Feature engineering & PCA** on 10,000+ historical prices with NumPy  
- **Trained models**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python, SQL  
- NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyTorch  
- Google Colab for prototyping and visualization  

## 🚀 Future Work
- Real-time data ingestion  
- Model tuning and LSTM implementation  
- Sentiment integration with real-time news feeds
